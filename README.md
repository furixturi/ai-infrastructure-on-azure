## 1. Overview

This repository provides infrastructure validation tests, deployment references,
AI training examples, and operational guidance for running GPU workloads on Azure
across three orchestrators — [Azure CycleCloud Workspace for Slurm](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cyclecloud/overview-ccws?view=cyclecloud-8),
[Azure Kubernetes Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/what-is-aks),
and [Azure Machine Learning](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/?view=azureml-api-2) —
with storage coverage for [Azure Blob Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/storage/blobs),
[Azure Managed Lustre](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-managed-lustre/amlfs-overview),
and [Azure NetApp Files](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-netapp-files/azure-netapp-files-introduction).

## 8. AI Infrastructure MCP Server

The [AI Infrastructure MCP Server](./tools/ai-infrastructure-mcp/README.md) is a
Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides tools for managing and
monitoring Slurm-based HPC clusters. It enables AI assistants like GitHub
Copilot to interact with cluster infrastructure through a standardized protocol,
offering capabilities such as:

- **Slurm job management** - Query job status, accounting data, and cluster
  information
- **System monitoring** - Check systemd services and logs across cluster nodes
- **File operations** - Read and search files on the cluster
- **Azure VM metadata** - Retrieve physical hostnames and VMSS information

Currently targeting Slurm clusters with SSH-based connectivity. See the
[full documentation](./tools/ai-infrastructure-mcp/README.md) for setup and
usage details.
